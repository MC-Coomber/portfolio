Welcome to the source code for my porfolio!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I've used [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/studio) as a headless CMS and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to build and deploy the site.

## Want to run it yourself?

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
